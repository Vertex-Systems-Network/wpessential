# WPEssential

WPEssential is a modular WordPress application platform for structured data, automation, integrations, admin tooling, workflows, and AI-ready operations.

Project website: **https://wpessential.org**

> **Status:** Phase 0 planning is complete. Source development is active under explicit `GOV-OWNER-CONSENT-001` and remains milestone-gated. Production deployment and separately privileged destructive/live-provider operations are not implied by source-development approval.

## Current lifecycle

- Accepted product scope: **56/56 Exhaustive**
- Multisite planning: **56/56**
- AI Prompt planning: **56/56**
- Planning closure/integration authority: through **ADR-0213**
- Implementation Baseline: **WP119 / ADR-0214 PASS**
- Machine-enforced architecture guards: **WP120 / ADR-0215 PASS**
- Platform Foundation: **WP121 CURRENT / IMPLEMENTING**
- Owner engineering contract: **ADR-0216**
- Atomic compiled-registration persistence: **ADR-0217**
- Definition + Audit persistence: **ADR-0218**

The current implementation branch is `implementation/baseline-adoption-gate`. Draft PR #2 carries the Platform Foundation work.

## What WPEssential is

WPEssential is designed as one governed platform rather than a collection of unrelated mini-frameworks. Business modules compose shared contracts for:

- canonical data and semantic ownership;
- definitions and compiled WordPress registrations;
- capability and Policy authorization;
- Abilities and typed events;
- scoped persistence and migrations;
- jobs and external integrations;
- audit and diagnostics;
- WordPress bridges, AJAX, nonce and runtime security;
- Multisite isolation;
- AI/MCP-safe invocation boundaries.

Core rule: every business semantic has one canonical owner. UI, REST, Workflow, Cron, CLI and AI are invocation channels and cannot create private duplicate engines or bypass the canonical owner Policy/Ability/storage path.

## Engineering contract

Production implementation must preserve:

- namespace `WPEssential`;
- canonical PSR-4 source root `frameworks/`;
- global functions `wpessential_*`;
- constants `WPE_*`;
- exact custom filters `wpesential/apply_*`;
- custom actions `wpessential/hook_*`;
- one typed allowlisted AJAX gateway;
- centralized nonce operation handling;
- compile-on-write runtime registrations;
- bounded/redacted Runtime Observatory diagnostics;
- direct-access `ABSPATH` guards on shipped PHP source.

The asymmetric `wpesential` filter spelling is intentional public API.

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution and WordPress.org release rules. `readme.txt` is the WordPress.org-facing plugin documentation draft for the current development line.

## Current foundation evidence

Hosted CI currently covers Composer metadata, canonical architecture/engineering guards, PHP syntax, smoke tests and MySQL integration fixtures. Accepted runtime evidence includes atomic compiled registrations and scoped Definition/Audit persistence. Evidence for unfinished areas is not promoted to production certification.

Current downstream Platform Foundation work includes real WordPress AJAX/nonce/Policy integration, Action Scheduler coexistence/backend evidence, durable Job persistence, Platform/Runtime Observatory admin surfaces, 10K/100K compiled-registration performance evidence, and the final shared-foundation readiness gate before business-module development.
